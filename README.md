# Bugged-Matrix
1 vs 1 Arena Shooter Game - but with bad physics and bad controls

## GUI Design

### Main Funcionalities

- Main Menu: From here the player can select to play against CPU/another human.
- Difficulty: In case the player selects to play against CPU he will have multiple difficulties to select from.
- 2 Player: This will be different in the Desktop and Android version of the game. on Desktop, both player will be able to play in the same computer, using different keyboard keys. On Android, the player will have to connect (we still are unsure of how we will do this, probably peer-to-peer connection) to another player and will play online.
- Game: Where the game will be displayed. On the Desktop version there will only be displayed the map, both players models(with different coloers), their weapons, their bullets and the "bullets tracers". On the Android version, their will be a joystick so he player can controll it's model (while he does it with the keyboard on Desktop) (we may latter opt to use the gyroscope, but we currently feal it would be bad from a gameplay standpoint)
- GameOver: The game will be a best-of-X (still to be decided) and when it ends a menu will be displayed with the otpions to play again (with the same opponent) or back to main menu.
